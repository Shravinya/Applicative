# ML-Driven Sorting and searching Optimization

## 🔍 Overview

This project introduces an **intelligent sorting algorithm recommender system** powered by **machine learning**. It analyzes the characteristics of a dataset and dynamically predicts the most suitable sorting algorithm (QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort) to apply. The solution is deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to ensure scalability, real-time access, and performance.
